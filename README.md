# keylimepi-stats
Just a small web interface which shows you your Raspberry Pi stats such as temperature, CPU-, RAM-, disk- and network usage and DSL bandwith speedtests.
<br/>It's is powered by 
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js">Chart.js</a> (not in this repo)</li>
	<li><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/develop/download.html">Foundation 5</a> (already here)</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli">speedtest-cli</a> (not in this repo)</li>
</ul>
It works on desktop computers, tablets and smartphones (yaay such responsive, very grid).
<br/>This is just a small quick project I've been working on so don't expect any high quality N(A)SA stuff here. I would write it a little bit different if I want some nice code with super syntax and maximum performance but hey... you probably visit this site once a week and you wouldn't even pay attention to all this stuff under the HTML layer.
<br/>If you really want to use this on your own Rasp (or any other linux system) you should make some changes to make it work well on your device (see <b>MakeItFit.md</b>).
